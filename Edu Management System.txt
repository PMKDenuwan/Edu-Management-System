I have to planned to create 'Edu Management System' for managing Students, Courses, Modules and Teachers information.
Here is the Entities and its attributes of this system.
I need to create frontend only using html css js(used basics ones)
Every page have sidebar with four tabs. They are Students Course Modules Teachers.Defaultly selected Students
 No need to implement all four pages at starting point just move on Students.
Now move on Students...
There is a heading call Students, Under that :
right side of the web page ,
1) Total Students 
2) Search bar 
And left side of the web page ,
There is a button called : "+ Add New Student"

Under these there is a table that exisiting all the information of the Students.
Here are the columns : 
Student id | Name | Address | Contact Number | Course | Course Fee | Action (Update Delete icons)

 **You need to fill this table using dummy data

When user clicks "+ Add New Student" button, It navigates to new page "Add New Student"
There is a forum.
Student ID : 
Address : 
Contact Number : 

Course ID: 
When user enter Course ID It must be showed automatically,
Course Name :
Duration :
Course Fee :   
and Table with three columns (Module ID, Module Name, Lecturer )

I have to planned to create 'Edu Management System' for managing Students, Courses, Modules and Teachers information using Spring Boot.
====Logical Schema of Edu Management System===
There are all 4 entities.
They are Student, Course, Teacher and Module

(1) Student- Course (M:N Relationship)
1 Student can join  1 or more courses
1 Course have 1 or more Students

(2) Course - Module (M:N Relationship)
1 Course have one or more Modules
1 Module includes one or more Courses

(3) Lecturer - Module (1:M Relationship)
Only 1 lecturer teaches one or more modules.
But 1 module can only have 1 lecturer

There are all 4 entities.
They are Student, Course, Teacher and Module

Here the entities and their attributes. 
Student | studnentID | sName | sAddress | sConatctNo | courseID
Course  | courseID   | cName | cFee | cDuration | moduleID
Module  | moduleID   | mName | mDuration |  cID | lID
Lecturer| lecturerID | nic   | lName    | lAddress |lContactNo | Salary

I need to clarify about the way I think is right, when planned this system.
If It is true, show me these things as table using dummy data.
