Student Attendance Management System  – Coursework II  

Project Overview  
You are required to develop a Student Attendance Management System (SAMS) to facilitate  
tracking and reporting student attendance for educational institutions. This system will help  
administrative staff and lecturers manage classes, monitor attendance, and generate  
attendance-related reports.  
Business Requirements  
Your system should address the following:

○ Store student profiles including name, registration number, course, and contact  
details.  
3. Lecturer Management  
○ Maintain lecturer profiles and their assigned subjects.  
4. Class Scheduling  
○ Create schedules for classes including course, subject, date, and lecturer. 
5. Attendance Marking  
○ Allow lecturers to mark attendance for students per class.  
6. Attendance Reporting 
○ Generate reports of attendance by student, subject, or date range.  
System Functionalities  
The application should provide the following functionalities:  
1. User Login  
○ Role-based access (e.g., Admin, Lecturer).  
2. Manage Courses (CRUD)  
○ Add, update, view, and delete course information.  
3. Manage Students (CRUD)  
○ Register new students, view student list, update details, or delete records. 
4. Manage Lecturers (CRUD)  
○ Add, update, and manage lecturer profiles and subject assignments. 
5. Class Management  
○ Schedule classes and assign them to specific courses and lecturers. 
6. Attendance Management  
○ Mark attendance per student per class session.  
7. Attendance Reports  
○ View or export attendance reports filtered by student, course, or date range.

Here I decided to do this assignment using MERN Stack


==============================================================
But I have these questions.
In course management,
1 course have multiple subjects.
Course -  Backend Developer 
Subjects - Java , JavaScript , Springboot

Course - Full Stack Developer
Subjects - Java , Springboot , React
Also one subject can includes many course.

Course - Frontend Developer

How manage this situation with Mongodb

In Student Management,
Within mongodb , how assign courses into students
1 Student can enrol many courses

In Lecture Management,
Within mongodb , how assign lectures to subjects
1 Lectures can teaches many subjects

How  attendance mark for students per class session And How Scheduling courses ?This is totally don't understand
(No any idea) 

Say how do these things with Mern,
How should backend and frontend behave
